# Baby Burrito for iOS: product and design spec

Status: spec, written 2026-10-09, moved here from `bridzius/baby-burrito-back` and updated with the decisions of the 2026-10-09 review. Companion to [plan.md](plan.md), which covers sync, sharing and the Live Activity internals. This document covers what the app is, how it looks and feels, and the budgets it must hit. Terms are defined in [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md); decisions with lasting consequences are in [adr/](adr/).

The app uses **no backend**. All data lives on the device and in the parents' own iCloud (CloudKit). The Rust service in `bridzius/baby-burrito-back` is not used.

## In one sentence

Log a feeding in one tap, at 3 a.m., with one hand, and always know when the next one is due.

## Principles

1. **One tap for the common case.** Most feedings repeat the previous one. Repeating it must take one tap, from the Lock Screen, Dynamic Island, Action button or the app.
2. **One screen.** Everything daily lives on Today. Trends and Settings are one push away. No tab bar, no onboarding tour, no accounts.
3. **Lively, not loud.** Motion, haptics and color confirm every action. Nothing blinks, nags or notifies.
4. **Native or nothing.** System components only, so the iOS 27 design comes for free and stays correct when Apple tunes it.
5. **Small and fast.** No third-party code, no images beyond the app icon, no network on the launch path.

## Platform target

|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OS               | **iOS 27 only.** Deployment target 27.0. No availability checks, no fallbacks                                                                                                        |
| Reference device | **iPhone 18 Pro**: 6.3", 2622 × 1206 px at 460 ppi (**402 × 874 pt @3x**), ProMotion up to 120 Hz, Always-On display, smaller Dynamic Island, Action button, Camera Control, A20 Pro |
| Other devices    | Any iPhone that runs iOS 27 must work correctly. Layouts are tuned and screenshotted on the 18 Pro first                                                                             |
| Not supported    | iPad, Mac, Apple Watch app, landscape (portrait only). The watch shows the Live Activity in its Smart Stack, with no watch app                                                                                                                                    |
| Languages        | English first. All strings in a String Catalog from day one, so adding a language is translation only                                                                                |
| Toolchain        | The Xcode that ships the iOS 27 SDK, Swift 6 language mode with strict concurrency                                                                                                   |

### iPhone 18 Pro specifics to design for

- **Smaller Dynamic Island.** Face ID's infrared camera moved under the display, so the pill is narrower. Compact Live Activity views get less width than on the 17 Pro. Design compact content for the narrower width and test on device. Reports say the island can show more simultaneous Live Activities; the app must look right when it isn't the primary one (minimal view).
- **Always-On display.** The Lock Screen Live Activity is visible all night on the nightstand. It must look good dimmed (see Live Activity).
- **120 Hz.** Scrolling and transitions must hold 120 fps. No layout work inside timers.
- **Action button.** Can run an App Shortcut. "Log feeding" is offered as one (see System surfaces).

## Design language: Liquid Glass on iOS 27

iOS 27 keeps Liquid Glass but refines it: default transparency is lower, the glass material itself was revised for legibility, and users get a system slider from clearer to more tinted glass. Search returns into the tab bar. What this means for us:

- **Use system components and let the system draw the glass.** `NavigationStack`, toolbars, sheets, menus, `Button` styles all pick up the current material, the user's transparency setting, Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast automatically. **Never draw custom blur or hard-code a material.** Custom glass, if ever needed, uses `.glassEffect()` inside a `GlassEffectContainer`, nothing else.
- **Glass is for controls, not content.** Content (the countdown, the feed list, charts) sits on the plain system background. Controls float above it in glass: the bottom quick-log bar, toolbar buttons and sheets.
- **One accent, three kind colors.** The accent tints prominent glass buttons. Each feeding kind has a color used for its symbol, chart series and chips. The colors are warm and calm, never red, because a baby app shouldn't feel like an alarm.

  | Kind                 | Color | Symbol (SF Symbols, final pick at design time) |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
  | Nursing              | Rose  | custom template symbol, fallback `heart.fill`  |
  | Breast milk (bottle) | Amber | `drop.fill`                                    |
  | Formula (bottle)     | Teal  | `waterbottle.fill`                             |

- **Type.** SF Pro with `.fontDesign(.rounded)` for all numbers (countdown, ml, minutes) and `.monospacedDigit()` wherever digits tick. Large, friendly numerals are the main visual element.
- **Concentric shapes.** Cards and buttons use the system's concentric corner radii (`ConcentricRectangle` / container-relative shapes) so they nest cleanly inside the rounded display and sheets.
- **Light and dark.** Follow the system appearance. Dark mode is the night mode: no pure white surfaces, kind colors desaturated slightly.
- **Icon.** A layered Liquid Glass app icon made in Icon Composer (a swaddled baby burrito). It must read in light, dark, tinted and clear modes.

**Verify at implementation time** against the iOS 27 Human Interface Guidelines and SwiftUI release notes. The glass APIs named here are the iOS 26 ones; iOS 27 changes reported so far are visual tuning that system components inherit.

## Making it lively

| Moment         | Feedback                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feeding logged | `.sensoryFeedback(.success)`, the kind symbol does a `.bounce` symbol effect, totals roll with `.contentTransition(.numericText())` |
| Countdown      | System-rendered `Text(timerInterval:)` and a progress ring that fills smoothly. No app timers                                       |
| Feeding due    | Ring completes, the label changes to "Due now" with a gentle `.pulse` on the symbol for the first minute. Then it counts up softly ("12 min ago", "1 h 5 min ago"). The Live Activity shows "Due · 0:12 ago" (see System surfaces) |
| Undo           | Spring the row back out, `.sensoryFeedback(.impact(weight: .light))`                                                                |
| Swipe delete   | The row leaves immediately with a light haptic; an Undo bar shows in the bottom toolbar area for 5 s                                 |
| Side picker    | Picking left/right animates a small highlight between the two halves, like a segmented control                                      |
| Empty state    | An SF Symbol (picked at design time, e.g. `teddybear.fill`) in a `.breathe` animation and one button: "Log the first feeding". Not the icon's burrito, which would need a bundled image |

Copy is short and warm: "Burrito ate 90 ml", "Next in 1 h 20 min", "Due now". No exclamation marks at night.

All motion respects Reduce Motion (springs become cross-fades, symbol effects are skipped).

## Screens

Wireframes are at the reference width of 402 pt. One `NavigationStack`, with **Today** as its root.

```

- **Repeat button** (bottom left, wide, `.glassProminent`): shows exactly what it will log, following the plan's repeat rule: bottles repeat kind and amount; nursing repeats the duration on the other breast with `fedAt = now − duration`. One tap logs and shows the confirmation (below). Hidden for viewers.
- **＋ button**: opens the Log sheet prefilled from the last feeding.
- **History is the same list**: Today scrolls back through all days. There is no separate History screen.
- **One baby in v1**: the title is the baby's name, with no menu. A phone holds exactly one baby log (see Data and storage). A baby switcher in the title menu is backlog.
- **Author**: a feeding shows its author only when someone other than you logged it, by their given name, or "Partner" when iCloud gives no name. Your own feedings carry no name.
- **Swipe delete**: deletes immediately, with a 5 s Undo that restores the same feeding. The CloudKit delete is sent only after the Undo window closes.
- **Viewer role**: the bottom toolbar is replaced by a quiet "Shared by Mom · view only" label. Swipe actions are off.

### Log sheet

A sheet at the medium detent, expandable to large. Prefilled from the last feeding. Also used to edit an existing feeding.

```

- Chips come from the baby's recent history, not fixed lists, so the common amount is always one tap: the five most frequent values **for that kind** over the **last 14 days** (ties go to the more recent value), shown sorted by value. With fewer than five, they are filled from the defaults (bottles 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 ml; nursing 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 min), skipping duplicates. The stepper always covers the full range.
- Validation is live and mirrors the Domain rules; **Done** is disabled with an inline reason when invalid. The fields of the other kind are never shown, so they can't be invalid.
- `fedAt` defaults to now for bottles and to now − duration for nursing, recalculated when the duration changes until the user touches the time.
- The time picker only offers valid times: from the start of the baby's birth day to now + 5 minutes.

### Logged confirmation

Shown after any one-tap log (Repeat button, Live Activity tap, Action button). It is the Log sheet in a "logged" state:

- Title "Logged 17:05" with the kind symbol bouncing, and a large **Undo** button.
- The fields are live: changing them edits **that same feeding** (never a duplicate).
- Dismisses itself after 8 seconds with no interaction, so a parent holding a baby can just put the phone down.

### Trends

Pushed from Today.

- Range picker: 7 days / 30 days.
- **Bottles**: daily stacked bars of ml by kind, with the daily average as a rule mark.
- **Nursing**: daily bars of minutes split by side (left / right / both), so imbalance is visible.
- **Rhythm**: average and longest interval per day, start to start.
- Tapping a day scrolls Today's list to that day.
- Charts carry `accessibilityChartDescriptor` so VoiceOver users get audio graphs.

### Settings

Pushed from the toolbar gear. A plain grouped `Form`.

- **Baby**: name, birth date (required, on or after 2026-01-01), feeding interval (stepper in 15-minute steps, 15 min–12 h, plus chips 2 h, 2½ h, 3 h, 3½ h, 4 h). Editable by the owner and editors; it syncs, so both parents count down to the same time.
- **Sharing**: invite (system share sheet), participants and their roles, stop sharing / leave.
- **Lock Screen**: "Show on Lock Screen" toggle with a live preview of the activity. Explains how to re-enable Live Activities if the system has them off.
- **iCloud status**: a single row, only shown when something needs attention.
- **Delete all data** (owner only): deletes the baby log from this phone and iCloud, with a confirmation. When the log is shared, the confirmation names the participants ("Deletes Burrito's log from this phone, iCloud, and Dad's phone"). Then First run.
- **Leave Burrito's log** (participants, instead of Delete all data): leaves the share, wipes the local copy, then First run.

### First run

Two steps, no tour:

1. Baby's name, birth date (required; no default, the picker starts at today) and feeding interval (default 3 h), with a "Joining your partner's log? Open their invite link" note for the second parent.
2. "Show on Lock Screen" with the preview and one button to turn it on. Skipping leaves it off until turned on in Settings. The setting is per phone and does not sync.

Then Today, in its empty state.

## System surfaces

All of them show last and next feeding. Those marked so log a repeat of the last feeding by opening the app; logging always happens in the foreground app ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-log-only-in-the-foreground-app.md)).

| **Always-On display**                                   | Same Lock Screen view; under `isLuminanceReduced` the progress fill and kind colors go monochrome and the seconds are hidden | n/a                                    |
| **StandBy** (phone charging on its side at the bedside) | The Lock Screen view, scaled up by the system. Must be legible from across the room: the countdown is the largest element    | Same                                   |

| **Control Center**                                      | A control "Log feeding" with the same intent                                                                                 | Same                                   |
| **Home Screen widget** (small, medium)                  | Countdown + last feeding, using the Live Activity views                                                                      | Opens the app only, never logs         |
| **Siri / Shortcuts**                                    | "Log 90 ml formula", "When is the next feeding?" via App Intents and App Shortcuts                                           | Logging intents open the app (`openAppWhenRun`) and show the confirmation; the question is answered in the background |

There are **no notifications**. The Live Activity replaces them.

Viewers (read-only participants) get every display surface, and taps only open the app.

## Data and storage

Defined in [plan.md](plan.md); summary:

- **Storage:** CloudKit. One record zone per baby in the owner's private database, shared as a whole with the other parent through a zone-wide `CKShare` (read-only or read-write). All fields are `encryptedValues`, end-to-end encrypted.
- **Local:** SwiftData store (`cloudKitDatabase: .none`) in an App Group, so the app reads and writes locally first and the widget extension can read it. `CKSyncEngine` syncs it, one engine per database.
- **Records:** `Baby` (name, birth date, feeding interval) and `Feeding` (start time, kind, ml or duration + side). Birth date is required by the app, though the CloudKit field cannot be marked required.
- **One baby log per phone (v1):** a phone holds either a baby log it owns or one it participates in. Accepting an invite while owning a log asks to replace it ("Your own log (3 feedings) will be deleted from this phone and your iCloud"); Cancel keeps it and does not accept. Feedings are never merged ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-one-baby-log-per-phone.md)).
- **Offline:** everything works offline; changes sync later.

## Budgets

Measured on an iPhone 18 Pro, release build. They are acceptance criteria, not goals.

### Code constraints that keep it small

- **No third-party dependencies.** Apple frameworks only: SwiftUI, SwiftData, CloudKit, ActivityKit, WidgetKit, AppIntents, Charts.
- **One local Swift package, `BabyCore`**, shared by the app and the widget extension so code isn't duplicated in two binaries. It has two flat targets: `Domain` (Foundation only) and `BabyCore` (Persistence, Sync, Sharing, Activity content; depends on `Domain`). The split keeps `Domain` from importing other package modules; a CI check rejects any import other than Foundation.
- **No custom fonts, images, Lottie or analytics.** Animations are SwiftUI and SF Symbol effects.
- **Pure `Domain`.** Validation and statistics are framework-free Swift, ported from [`src/feedings/mod.rs`](https://github.com/bridzius/baby-burrito-back/blob/main/src/feedings/mod.rs) and [`src/stats.rs`](https://github.com/bridzius/baby-burrito-back/blob/main/src/stats.rs) with the same test cases, except millisecond truncation, which only existed for Postgres. On device, `fedAt` must lie between the start of the baby's birth day and now + 5 minutes.

## Accessibility

- **Dynamic Type:** every size up to AX5. At accessibility sizes the Today header stacks vertically and the bottom toolbar keeps only the Repeat button with the ＋ moved to the toolbar.
- **VoiceOver:** the countdown reads as "Next feeding in 1 hour 23 minutes, at 5:05 PM". Feeding rows read as one element ("Nursing, left breast, 15 minutes, 2:05 PM, logged by Dad"; the author only when it is not you), with edit, delete and an Undo after delete as custom actions.
- **Targets:** primary actions at least 60 pt tall, all in the bottom half of the screen for one-handed use while holding a baby.
- **Contrast and transparency:** handled by system components (Increase Contrast, Reduce Transparency, the iOS 27 glass slider). Kind colors meet 4.5:1 on both backgrounds for text uses.
- **Color is never the only signal:** every kind also has its symbol and name.

## Privacy

- No accounts, no server, no analytics, no crash reporting SDKs. The developer never receives any data.
- Data lives in the user's iCloud, end-to-end encrypted, and is shared only with participants the owner invites.
- Expected App Store privacy label: **Data Not Collected** (confirm at submission).
- Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) declares no tracking and only the required-reason APIs actually used.

## Non-goals (v1)

- iPad, Mac, Apple Watch apps and watch-face complications. The watch shows the Live Activity in the Smart Stack.
- More than one baby on a phone (the title-menu switcher is backlog). The storage stays one zone per baby so it can be added later.
- App Store release. v1 ends with both parents on a TestFlight build; submission is an optional follow-up.
- Notifications of any kind.
- Diapers, sleep, growth, pumping, medications. Feedings only.
- Units other than ml.
- Export. Possibly v2 as a CSV via the share sheet.
- Nursing timer (decided: after v1).
- Any server, including a push relay (see the plan's trade-off).

## Acceptance (v1 is done when)

- [ ] A one-tap repeat from the Lock Screen, the Dynamic Island, the Action button and the Repeat button each logs exactly one correct feeding and shows the confirmation with Undo.
- [ ] The Log sheet logs nursing (side + duration) and bottles (kind + ml) and rejects invalid input inline.
- [ ] Both parents see the same feedings and the same next feeding time, with the second parent as viewer and as editor.
- [ ] The Smart Stack on Apple Watch shows the next feeding, and tapping it never logs.
- [ ] Both parents use a TestFlight build daily against the Production CloudKit environment.
- [ ] The Live Activity survives a full night of feedings, is legible on the Always-On display and in StandBy, and looks right in the 18 Pro's smaller Dynamic Island.
- [ ] Every budget in the table above is met on an iPhone 18 Pro.
- [ ] Works fully offline, and syncs when back online.
- [ ] VoiceOver and AX5 Dynamic Type walkthroughs of Today, Log and Trends pass.

## Decisions made

- **Nursing timer:** not in v1. Revisit after v1 is in daily use. It needs no schema change, since a feeding is only written when the timer stops.
- **Repo:** the app lives in its own repo, `bridzius/baby-burrito-ios`. This repo (`baby-burrito-back`) keeps the Rust fallback and these docs.
- **Baby switcher:** not in v1; one baby log per phone. When added, it lives in Today's title menu and the Live Activity follows the selected baby.
- **Widget tap:** opens the app only. Accidental taps on the unlocked Home Screen would log feedings.
- **Siri and Shortcuts:** every logging intent opens the app, so there is one logging path with one confirmation.
- **Show on Lock Screen:** in First run and Settings only, per phone.
- **Birth date:** required, on or after 2026-01-01; it is the floor for `fedAt`.
- **Validation:** only local writes are validated. Synced records are stored as they arrive ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-validate-only-local-writes.md)).
- **Delete vs leave:** owners delete, participants leave. A participant whose log disappears goes back to First run with one line saying why.
- **Watch:** Smart Stack layout only, no watch app.
- **Release:** v1 ends at TestFlight.
